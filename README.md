### Installation

#### UNIX

To install on UNIX systems, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or, using `wget`:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows

To install on Windows, run the following command in PowerShell:

```pwsh
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize the installation by passing environment variables to the installation script:

- `BRANCH` (for Bash) or `-Branch` (for PowerShell): Specify the branch you want to install. Defaults to `master`.
- `SSH` (for Bash) or `-SSH` (for PowerShell): Set to `true` if you want to install the dotfiles with SSH. Defaults to `false`.
- `ONE_SHOT` (for Bash) or `-OneShot` (for PowerShell): Set to `true` to install your dotfiles and then remove all traces of chezmoi from the system. Useful for setting up temporary environments (e.g., Docker containers). Defaults to `false`.

For example, to install using a specific branch:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | BRANCH="dev" bash
```

#### Binding Flags

From the [Hyprland binding flags reference](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#bind-flags):

- `l` - locked, will also work when an input inhibitor (e.g. a lockscreen) is active.
- `r` - release, will trigger on release of a key.
- `e` - repeat, will repeat when held.
- `n` - non-consuming, key/mouse events will be passed to the active window in addition to triggering the dispatcher.
- `t` - transparent, cannot be shadowed by other binds.
- `i` - ignore mods, will ignore modifiers.
- `s` - separate, will arbitrarily combine keys between each mod/key, see [Keysym combos](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#keysym-combos).
