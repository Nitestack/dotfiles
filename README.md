## üöÄ Features

### NixOS (Full System)

This setup operates on the [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) protocol, utilizing [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) as the compositor for smooth and visually pleasing window management. For login management, [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm) is employed with a custom theme, providing a refined interface. The system uses [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub) as the bootloader, enhanced with a theme and `os-prober` for seamless dual-booting with Windows or other operating systems.

Everything is built using a [Nix Flake](https://nix.dev/concepts/flakes.html), ensuring the system is reproducible. It also includes features listed in the [Cross-Platform](#cross-platform-nixos-windows) and [UNIX](#unix-nixos) sections, making it a complete and functional environment.

### Cross-Platform (NixOS, Windows)

- **Neovim Configuration (with WSL)**: Powered by [LazyVim](http://www.lazyvim.org), ensuring a robust text editing experience.

- **WezTerm Configuration**: Integrated Neovim workflow for a seamless terminal and text editing setup.

- **Oh My Posh Configuration (with WSL)**: Customized prompt for a visually appealing and informative shell experience.

- **Fastfetch Configuration (with WSL)**: Customized settings for efficient system information display.

- **Lazygit Configuration (with WSL)**: Themed with the [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/lazygit) theme for a cohesive look and feel.

- **Git Configuration (with WSL)**: Customized settings for version control.

- **ShellCheck Configuration (with WSL)**: Setup for shell script analysis.

- **SSH Configuration (with WSL)**: Consistent and secure SSH setup across systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Ensure you have the latest stable release of [NixOS](https://nixos.org), [Windows](https://microsoft.com/windows), or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) installed.

### WSL (NixOS)

Ensure you have the latest release of [NixOS-WSL](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL/releases/latest) downloaded.

Open PowerShell and run:

```pwsh
wsl --import NixOS --version 2 $env:USERPROFILE\NixOS\ nixos-wsl.tar.gz
```

#### Post-Install

After the initial installation, update your channels to use `nixos-rebuild`:

```sh
sudo nix-channel --update
```

Then rebuild the system:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

To make NixOS your default distribution, use:

```pwsh
wsl -s NixOS
```

### NixOS (including WSL)

Ensure you have `git` and `chezmoi` available when needed in the installation section.

```sh
nix-shell -p git chezmoi
```

### Windows

Ensure you have `git`, `chezmoi`, and `pwsh` installed.

```pwsh
winget install -e --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements Git.Git twpayne.chezmoi Microsoft.PowerShell
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All versions of Windows come with PowerShell 5.1 pre-installed. However, this repository requires PowerShell 7.x or higher. PowerShell 7.x+ does not replace or upgrade PowerShell 5.1; it is installed alongside it.
