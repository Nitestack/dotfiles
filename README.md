## üöÄ Features

### NixOS (Full System)

> [!WARNING]
> The NixOS full system configuration is still incomplete! The key feature yet to be implemented is the integration of [Astal](https://aylur.github.io/astal) and [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs). This requires a rewrite from the previous Arch-based version of the dotfiles, meaning there is currently no top or bottom bar, and the power menu is also missing.

This setup operates on the [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) protocol, utilizing [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) as the compositor to deliver a smooth and visually pleasing window management experience. For login management, [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm) is employed with a custom theme, providing a refined and polished interface. The system uses [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub) as the bootloader, enhanced with a theme and os-prober for seamless dual-booting with Windows or other operating systems. To further elevate the visual aesthetic, both [Astal](https://aylur.github.io/astal) and [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs) are used, creating a cohesive design for app launchers, power and notification menus, top and bottom bars, and more.

Everything is built using a [Nix Flake](https://nix.dev/concepts/flakes.html), ensuring the system is reproducible. It also includes all the features listed in the [Cross-Platform](#cross-platform-nixos-macos-windows) and the [UNIX](#unix-nixos-macos) section, making it a complete and fully functional environment.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Installation

#### UNIX

To install on UNIX systems, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or, using `wget`:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows

To install on Windows, run the following command in PowerShell:

```pwsh
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize the installation by passing environment variables to the installation script:

- `BRANCH` (for Bash) or `-Branch` (for PowerShell): Specify the branch you want to install. Defaults to `master`.
- `SSH` (for Bash) or `-SSH` (for PowerShell): Set to `true` if you want to install the dotfiles with SSH. Defaults to `false`.
- `ONE_SHOT` (for Bash) or `-OneShot` (for PowerShell): Set to `true` to install your dotfiles and then remove all traces of chezmoi from the system. Useful for setting up temporary environments (e.g., Docker containers). Defaults to `false`.

For example, to install using a specific branch:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | BRANCH="dev" bash
```

```pwsh
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.ps1 | iex -Branch "dev"
```
