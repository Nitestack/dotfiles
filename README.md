```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitestack/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | bash

### Environment Variables

You can customize the installation by passing environment variables to the installation script:

- `BRANCH` (for Bash) or `-Branch` (for PowerShell): Specify the branch you want to install. Defaults to `master`.
- `SSH` (for Bash) or `-SSH` (for PowerShell): Set to `true` if you want to install the dotfiles with SSH. Defaults to `false`.
- `ONE_SHOT` (for Bash) or `-OneShot` (for PowerShell): Set to `true` to install your dotfiles and then remove all traces of chezmoi from the system. Useful for setting up temporary environments (e.g., Docker containers). Defaults to `false`.

For example, to install using a specific branch:

```sh
